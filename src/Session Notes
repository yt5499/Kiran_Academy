NOTES

6/09/2023

1. the variable is name given to some memory location
2. the variables are used to store the values
3. when we need to store the values, we must use variables.
4. we can take n number of variables in our program; but we should take only required number of variables.

~ namming conventions=
1. any combination of a-z A-Z 0-9 _ and $ are allowed
2. the var name should not start with digit
3. keywords are not allowed as a variable name

~Operators:

1. Arithmatic- basic math operations
2. relational- comparison
3. Assignment- to assign the value
4. logical- think logically and give final response
5. increament/decreeament
6. bitwise - bit by bit binary
7. misc- mixures

1. Arithmetic operators:-
	+ plus == adds the values
	- minus == substracts the values
	* asterisk == multiplies
	/ slash == divides and gives quotient
	% modulas == divides and gives remainder
	
2. Relational operators(is the only operator which returns only true or false):-
	<   --  less than
	<=  --  less than or equal to
	>   --  greater than
	>=  --  greater than or equal to
	==  --  equal equal to
	!=  --  not equal to

3. Assignment operators:-
	=	--	assigns the value
	+=	--	adds the value using short-form(eg- int a += 2 --> int a = a+2)
	-=	--	                      |same|
	*=	--	                      |same|
	/=	--	                      |same|
	%=	--	                      |same|
	<<=	--	
	>>=	--	
	<<<<=	--	
	>>>>=	--
	
4. Logical operators:-
	1. &&	--	AND
	Truth table --
	i/p	i/p	o/p
	0	0	0
	0	1	0
	1	0	0
	1	1	1
	
	
	2. ||	--	OR
	Truth table --
	i/p	i/p	o/p
	0	0	0
	0	1	0
	1	0	0
	1	1	1
	
	
	3. ~	--	NOT
	Truth table --
	i/p	o/p
	0	1
	1	0

IB- Instance block

1. IB is optional
2. we can write n number of ib's in the class
3. the ib gets called everytime when instance is created
4. In case of multiple IB's top - down sequence is follwed 
5. In case of multiple IB's ALL IB's will be called for all objects
6. In case of multiple IBs, last IB value set is mainted
7. The nested IBs are not allowed
8. We can write n number of lines of coode in IB

October 7
SB- Static Block
1. SB is optional
2. we can write n number of SB's in the class
3. the SB gets called every time when instance is created
4. In case of multiple SB's top - down sequence is followed 
5. When class is loaded into memory, SB gets called/executed
6. In case of multiple SBs, ALL  SB value will be called
7. The nested SBs are not allowed
8. We can write n number of lines of code in SB
9. SB can acccess ONLY static variables
10. The IB can access BOTH static as well as non-static variables


October 9:
Constructor: It is a special method which has same name as that of class and it has no return type; not even void.

We must use new keyword to call constructor, Without new keyword, the constructor cannot be called.

Types of constructors:
1. Parameterized(define by developers)
2. Non-Parameterized(define by developers)
3. Default (Defined by system)

The default constructor is written/provided by the system IF and ONLY IF developer has NOT defined any constructor in the class

The default constructor has NO parameters


-----
The developer can NOT define/edit/see default constructor.
We can define multiple constructors in the class with the unique signatures.
The priority flows like SB -> IB -> Constructor.
The constructor should be called 'n' times to create 'n' objects.



October 11:
Inheritance(Day 2) - It is process of creating new class(Sub/Child Class) extending pre-existing class(Super/Parent Class), where extended class 
	access all properties of Super-Class.
	
1. The final keyword stops the inheritance
2. The final class can not be extended
3. The constructor of parent has more priority than IB of child
4. Using classes, multiple inheritance is not possible. However we can achieve it by using interface.
5. In case of IBs, IB Parent -> IB Child
6. In case of SBs, SB Parent -> SB Child
7. In case of Constructor, Cons Parent -> Cons Child
8. In case of IBs, SBs and Constructors,
	SB Parent -> SB Child -> IB Parent -> Cons Parent -> IB Child -> Cons Child
9. The hybrid inheritance is combination of any of other types.
10. Only single/simple inheritance can have fixed diagram. Other types involves 'n' classes.
11. Minimum number of classes for Hierarchy, multiple, multi-level and Hybrid types is THREE.  


October 12:
Polymorphism: An ability to gain multiple forms.

Polymorphism Types
1. Overloading (Synonyms)
* Method Overloading
* Early binding
* Static Polymorphism
* Compile Time Poly.

2. Overriding(Synonyms)
* Method Overriding
* Late binding
* Dynamic Polymorphism
* Run Time Poly.

#OverLoading:

Method overloading = Normal task + Extra task

Notes-
1. Methods with SAME name but DIFFERENT signature are called as Overloaded method.
2. We can overload a method 'n' times.
3. Whenever we need to achieve some functionality in different ways, we can overload a method.
4. The constructor can be overloaded.
